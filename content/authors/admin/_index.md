I'm a 5th year PhD student at the University of Maryland, College Park. I'm fortunate to be co-advised by professors [Aravind Srinivasan](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~srin/) and [John Dickerson](http://jpdickerson.com/). My research interests revolve around Algorithmic Fairness and Stochastic Models for Combinatorial Optimization. Specifically, I'm interested in identifying meaningful notions of fairness, translating them into formal mathematical objects, and finally incorporating them in classical algorithmic problems. I'm also interested in the interplay of stochasticity and fairness, and how the former can be utilized in order to come with socially fair algorithmic outcomes.

Prior to joining the University of Maryland, I had the luck to be advised by professor [Dimitris Fotakis](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/) at NTUA, where I completed my undergrad studies.
